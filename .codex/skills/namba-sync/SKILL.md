description: Command-style entry point for refreshing Namba project artifacts after implementation.
---

Use this skill when the user explicitly says `$namba-sync`, `namba sync`, or asks to refresh PR-ready Namba artifacts after changes.

Behavior:
- Refresh `.namba/project/*` docs, release notes/checklists, codemaps, advisory review readiness under `.namba/specs/<SPEC>/reviews/`, and any README bundles enabled by `.namba/config/sections/docs.yaml` after implementation.
- Keep PR creation and merge automation in `namba pr` and `namba land` so `sync` stays a local artifact refresh command.
- Use `namba regen` separately when template-generated scaffold assets changed.
- Run validation first when code changed and the quality config requires it.
