description: Codex-native Namba command surface for SPEC orchestration inside a repository.
---

Use this skill whenever the user mentions `namba`, `namba help`, `namba project`, `namba regen`, `namba update`, `namba codex access`, `namba plan`, `namba harness`, `namba fix`, `namba run`, `namba queue`, `namba sync`, `namba pr`, `namba land`, `namba release`, `$namba-help`, `$namba-coach`, `$namba-create`, `$namba-queue`, `$namba-plan-review`, `$namba-review-resolve`, `$namba-release`, or asks to use the Namba workflow.

Command mapping:
- `$namba-help`: explain how to use NambaAI in this repository, which command or skill to use next, and where the authoritative docs live, without mutating repository state.
- `$namba-coach`: restate the user's current goal, ask only essential routing questions when needed, correct clearly wrong command choices, and hand off to exactly one primary Namba workflow invocation without mutating repository state.
- `$namba-create`: run the skill-first creation workflow for repo-local skills, project-scoped custom agents, or both. Keep the user-facing surface inside Codex and do not add a public `namba create` CLI command in this slice.
- `namba project`: refresh repository docs and codemaps.
- `namba codex access`: inspect the current repo-owned Codex access defaults, or update `approval_policy` / `sandbox_mode` with explicit flags after initialization.
- `namba regen`: regenerate AGENTS, repo-local skills, command-entry skills, Codex custom agents, readable role cards, and repo-local Codex config from `.namba/config/sections/*.yaml`.
- `namba update [--version vX.Y.Z]`: self-update the installed `namba` binary from GitHub Release assets.
- `namba plan "<description>"`: create the next feature SPEC package under `.namba/specs/`, and when branch-per-work is enabled create or switch to the dedicated `spec/...` branch in the current workspace.
- `$namba-plan-review`: create or resolve a SPEC, run the three plan-review tracks in parallel when possible, and drive the advisory readiness loop before implementation starts.
- `namba harness "<description>"`: create the next harness-oriented SPEC package under `.namba/specs/` through the same dedicated-branch planning contract for reusable agent, skill, workflow, or orchestration work.
- `$namba-plan-pm-review` / `$namba-plan-eng-review` / `$namba-plan-design-review`: update product, engineering, or design review artifacts under `.namba/specs/<SPEC>/reviews/` and refresh advisory readiness.
- `namba fix --command plan "<issue description>"`: create the next bugfix SPEC package under `.namba/specs/` through the same dedicated-branch planning contract.
- `namba fix "<issue description>"` or `namba fix --command run "<issue description>"`: perform direct repair in the current workspace without creating a SPEC package.
- `$namba-review-resolve`: resolve the target PR from the current branch when possible, inspect unresolved review threads with thread-aware GitHub state, record thread identity and outcome, validate before replying or resolving, include CI/check evidence when relevant, and avoid duplicating the configured review marker.
- `$namba-release`: draft release notes from commits since the previous semver tag, write the notes to a durable per-version artifact, then hand off to the guarded `namba release --version <version> --push` path with a GitHub Release body that uses the generated notes.
- `namba run SPEC-XXX`: execute the SPEC in the current Codex session. Read `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `acceptance.md`, implement directly, validate, and sync artifacts.
- `namba run SPEC-XXX --solo|--team|--parallel`: use the standalone CLI runner when you need explicit single-subagent, multi-subagent, or worktree-parallel execution semantics.
- `namba queue start <SPEC-RANGE|SPEC-LIST>`: process already-existing SPEC packages one at a time through review, run, PR, checks, optional land, and local main refresh. Use `status`, `resume`, `pause`, and `stop` to operate the durable queue.
- `namba sync`: refresh change summary, PR checklist, codemaps, advisory review readiness, and PR-ready docs after implementation.
- `namba pr "<title>"`: run sync plus validation by default, inspect PR checks, summarize bounded GitHub Actions failure snippets when checks fail, commit and push the current branch, create or reuse a PR, and ensure the Codex review marker exists exactly once.
- `namba land`: resolve the current branch PR, optionally wait for checks, merge when the PR is clean, and update local `main` safely.
- `namba doctor`: verify that AGENTS, repo skills, `.namba` config, Codex CLI, and the global `namba` command are available.

Execution rules:
1. Treat `.namba/` as the source of truth.
2. Prefer repo-local skills in `.agents/skills/`.
3. Prefer `$namba-coach` for read-only current-goal command coaching, prefer `$namba-help` for read-only usage guidance, and prefer command-entry skills such as `$namba-create`, `$namba-run`, `$namba-queue`, `$namba-pr`, `$namba-land`, `$namba-release`, `$namba-plan`, `$namba-plan-review`, `$namba-harness`, `$namba-fix`, `$namba-review-resolve`, `$namba-plan-pm-review`, `$namba-plan-eng-review`, `$namba-plan-design-review`, `$namba-project`, and `$namba-sync` when the user is invoking one Namba command directly.
4. Use the installed `namba` CLI for `project`, `regen`, `update`, `codex access`, `plan`, `harness`, `fix`, `queue`, `pr`, `land`, `release`, and `sync` when it will update repo state more reliably or self-update the installed CLI directly.
5. Keep `.namba/specs/<SPEC>/reviews/*.md` and `readiness.md` current when you use the plan-review workflow; the readiness summary is advisory unless the user explicitly asks for a gate.
6. For `namba run` in an interactive Codex session, prefer Codex-native in-session execution over recursively calling `namba run`, unless the user explicitly asks for standalone `--solo`, `--team`, `--parallel`, or `--dry-run` behavior.
7. Run validation commands from `.namba/config/sections/quality.yaml` before finishing.
8. Start each new SPEC or task on a dedicated work branch when `.namba/config/sections/git-strategy.yaml` enables branch-per-work collaboration.
9. Prepare PRs against `main`, write the title/body in Korean, and request GitHub Codex review with `@codex review` when the review flow is enabled.
