description: Execute NambaAI SPEC packages with Codex-native workflow and explicit validation.
---

Use this skill when implementing a SPEC package.

Execution pattern:
1. Read `.namba/specs/<SPEC>/spec.md`
2. Read `.namba/specs/<SPEC>/plan.md`
3. Read `.namba/specs/<SPEC>/acceptance.md`
4. Read `.namba/specs/<SPEC>/reviews/readiness.md` when present so advisory review status informs execution
5. Read `.namba/specs/<SPEC>/frontend-brief.md` when present and treat it as the canonical frontend gate contract
6. If the SPEC is explicitly `frontend-major`, stop and route back to research/synthesis when the frontend gate is incomplete, invalid, or contradicted by design-review summaries
7. Implement the work directly in the current Codex session
8. For browser-rendered frontend changes, use managed server lifecycle, inspect rendered DOM state, capture screenshots, record console errors, and prefer Playwright checks when practical
9. Run configured validation commands
10. Summarize results in `.namba/logs` and sync artifacts

Collaboration defaults: use a dedicated branch from `main` for the SPEC, open the PR into `main`, write the PR in Korean, and request `@codex review` on GitHub after the PR is open.

Do not call `namba run` from inside Codex unless the user explicitly requests the non-interactive CLI runner.
