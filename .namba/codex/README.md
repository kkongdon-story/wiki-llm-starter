# Codex Integration

`wiki-llm-starter` is configured for Codex-native Namba workflow.

## What `namba init .` Enables

- Creates `AGENTS.md` with Namba orchestration rules.
- Creates repo-local skills under `.agents/skills/`, including read-only guidance plus command-entry skills such as `namba-help`, `namba-coach`, `namba-create`, `namba-run`, `namba-queue`, `namba-pr`, `namba-land`, `namba-release`, `namba-plan`, `namba-plan-review`, `namba-harness`, `namba-plan-pm-review`, `namba-plan-eng-review`, `namba-plan-design-review`, `namba-review-resolve`, and `namba-sync`.
- Creates task-oriented Codex custom agents under `.codex/agents/*.toml` and readable `.md` role-card mirrors.
- Creates repo-local Codex config under `.codex/config.toml`, keeping a narrow repo-safe baseline such as `approval_policy`, `sandbox_mode`, and agent thread limits, plus an allow-listed set of repo-managed MCP presets when configured.
- Creates `.namba/codex/output-contract.md` plus `.namba/codex/validate-output-contract.py` for NambaAI response-shape guidance and fallback validation.
- Creates `.namba/` project state, configs, docs, and SPEC storage.

## How Codex Uses Namba After Init

1. Open Codex in the initialized project directory.
   On Windows, the current official Codex docs recommend using a WSL workspace for the best CLI experience.
2. Codex loads `AGENTS.md` and repo skills.
3. Invoke `$namba` for routing, `$namba-coach` for read-only current-goal command coaching, `$namba-help` for read-only Namba usage guidance, or command-entry skills such as `$namba-create`, `$namba-run`, `$namba-queue`, `$namba-pr`, `$namba-land`, `$namba-release`, `$namba-plan`, `$namba-plan-review`, `$namba-harness`, `$namba-fix`, `$namba-review-resolve`, `$namba-plan-pm-review`, `$namba-plan-eng-review`, `$namba-plan-design-review`, and `$namba-sync` for direct command-style execution.
4. Use built-in Codex subagents such as `default`, `worker`, and `explorer`, plus project-scoped custom agents under `.codex/agents/*.toml`, when multi-agent work is appropriate. The matching `.md` files remain readable mirrors.
5. Use the plan-review skills to update `.namba/specs/<SPEC>/reviews/*.md` and keep `.namba/specs/<SPEC>/reviews/readiness.md` current when a SPEC needs product, engineering, or design critique before implementation, or use `$namba-plan-review` when you want the create-plus-review loop bundled into one Codex entry point.
6. Use `namba project`, `namba regen`, `namba update`, `namba codex access`, `namba plan`, `namba harness`, `namba fix`, `namba run SPEC-XXX`, `namba queue`, `namba sync`, `namba pr`, `namba land`, and `namba release` as workflow commands.
## Workflow Command Semantics

- `$namba-help` explains how to use NambaAI, which command to choose next, and where the authoritative docs live. It should stay read-only.
- `$namba-coach` clarifies the user's current goal, corrects clearly wrong command choices, and hands off to exactly one primary Namba workflow invocation. It should stay read-only.
- `$namba-create` is the preview-first creation path for repo-local skills and custom agents. Use it when the user wants `.agents/skills/*` or `.codex/agents/*` outputs directly instead of a SPEC package.
- `$namba-queue` operates the existing-SPEC queue conveyor: start from a SPEC range or list, inspect durable status, resume after waits or blockers, and pause or stop without deleting branches, PRs, or evidence.
- `$namba-review-resolve` resolves GitHub review threads one by one: discover unresolved thread state with a thread-aware GitHub path, classify meaningful feedback versus non-actionable remarks, reply on original threads with validation plus relevant CI/check evidence, and request review again only after the meaningful items are handled.
- `$namba-release` handles NambaAI release orchestration: collect commits since the previous semver tag, draft release notes into a durable per-version artifact, and hand the release off through the guarded `namba release --version <version> --push` path.
- `namba project` refreshes current repository docs and codemaps without creating a SPEC package.
- `namba codex access` inspects the current repo-owned Codex access defaults and mutates them only when explicit approval_policy / sandbox_mode flags are present.
- Permission profiles, models, auth, apps, web search, and platform sandbox choices stay user-owned unless NambaAI explicitly widens repo-managed config.
- Avoid deprecated Codex full-auto style flags; prefer explicit `approval_policy`, `sandbox_mode`, sandbox profile, and permission profile settings.
- `namba regen` regenerates `AGENTS.md`, repo skills under `.agents/skills/`, `.codex/agents/*.toml` custom agents, readable `.md` role-card mirrors, `.namba/codex/*`, and `.codex/config.toml` from `.namba/config/sections/*.yaml`.
- `namba update` self-updates the installed `namba` binary from GitHub Release assets. Use `--version vX.Y.Z` for a specific release.
- `codex update` updates the upstream Codex CLI itself. Keep it separate from `namba update`.
- `namba plan "<description>"` creates the next feature SPEC package plus review scaffolds.
- `namba harness "<description>"` creates the next harness-oriented SPEC package plus review scaffolds while staying inside the standard `SPEC-XXX` model; harness/MCP plans should favor workflow-first design, bounded outputs, actionable errors, and stable read-only evaluations.
- `namba fix --command plan "<issue description>"` creates the next bugfix SPEC package plus review scaffolds.
- `namba fix "<issue description>"` and `namba fix --command run "<issue description>"` are the direct-repair paths in the current workspace. They should stay read-only for help/probe flows, avoid implicit SPEC creation, and finish with validation plus `namba sync`.
- `namba sync` refreshes `.namba/project/*` docs, release notes/checklists, codemaps, and advisory review readiness summaries.
- `namba queue start <SPEC-RANGE|SPEC-LIST>` processes existing SPEC packages in order through review, run, PR, checks, and optional land, while durable state under `.namba/logs/queue/` makes waits, blockers, and resume decisions explicit.
- `namba pr` prepares the current branch for GitHub review by syncing, validating, inspecting PR checks, summarizing bounded GitHub Actions failure snippets when checks fail, committing, pushing, opening or reusing the PR, and ensuring the Codex review marker is present exactly once.
- `namba land` waits for checks when requested, merges a clean PR, and updates local `main` safely.
- `namba release` requires a clean `main` branch and passing validators before it creates a tag. `--push` pushes both `main` and the new tag.
- `namba run SPEC-XXX` keeps the standard standalone Codex flow when you use the CLI runner without extra mode flags, but explicit `frontend-major` work now reads `frontend-brief.md` as a canonical gate before coding.
- `namba run SPEC-XXX --solo` requests a standalone Codex run that explicitly targets a single-subagent workflow inside one workspace.
- `namba run SPEC-XXX --team` requests a standalone Codex run that explicitly coordinates multiple subagents inside one workspace.
- `namba run SPEC-XXX --parallel` still refers to the standalone worktree runner path. It uses git worktrees, merges only after every worker passes execution and validation, and preserves failed worktrees and branches for inspection.
- Codex `/goal` workflows are tracked as a future orchestration candidate, not a required Namba runtime dependency.

## Namba Custom Agent Roster

- Strategy and readiness: `namba-product-manager` shapes scope and acceptance, `namba-planner` turns a SPEC into an execution plan, and `namba-plan-reviewer` validates whether the product/engineering/design review set is coherent enough to start implementation.
- UI split: `namba-designer` owns art direction plus reference collection and synthesis, `namba-frontend-architect` plans hierarchy and state only after the frontend gate is satisfied, `namba-frontend-implementer` ships approved UI work only after synthesis plus design clearance, and `namba-mobile-engineer` handles mobile-specific constraints.
- Routing examples: `Redesign this landing page hero so it stops looking generic` -> `namba-designer`; `Plan the component/state split for this dashboard` -> `namba-frontend-architect`; `Implement the approved dashboard filters and responsive states` -> `namba-frontend-implementer`.
- Backend and data: `namba-backend-architect` plans service boundaries, `namba-backend-implementer` ships server-side changes, and `namba-data-engineer` owns data pipelines, transformations, migrations, and analytics-facing changes.
- Security and delivery: `namba-security-engineer` handles hardening work, `namba-test-engineer` adds targeted regression coverage, `namba-devops-engineer` handles CI/CD and runtime changes, and `namba-reviewer` checks implementation acceptance before sync.
- General delivery: `namba-implementer` remains the generalist execution agent for mixed-scope implementation slices.
- Built-in Codex subagents such as `explorer` and `worker` still matter; use the Namba custom roster when responsibility and output expectations need tighter framing.

## Delegation Heuristics

- Default `namba run` stays inside the standalone runner unless specialist signals are strong enough to justify delegation.
- `--solo` uses at most one specialist when one domain clearly dominates the request.
- `--team` prefers one specialist when one domain dominates and expands to two or three only when acceptance spans multiple domains.
- Repo-managed same-workspace defaults set `.codex/config.toml [agents].max_threads = 5` when `agent_mode: multi`; Namba worktree workers remain separately controlled by `.namba/config/sections/workflow.yaml max_parallel_workers: 3` unless a later SPEC changes that fan-out.
- Team mode honors each selected role's `model` and `model_reasoning_effort` metadata from `.codex/agents/*.toml`, keeping planner/reviewer/security roles stronger and delivery roles lighter.
- Route art direction plus reference synthesis to `namba-designer`; route component, state, and delivery planning only after the frontend gate is satisfied to `namba-frontend-architect`; route approved UI implementation only after synthesis plus design clearance to `namba-frontend-implementer`; route mobile-specific delivery to `namba-mobile-engineer`; route API, schema, and pipeline work to backend/data; route auth, secrets, and compliance work to security; route deployment and runtime work to devops.
- Keep the standalone runner as the integrator and final validation owner, and use `namba-reviewer` last when multiple specialists contribute.

## Plan Review Readiness

- `namba plan`, `namba harness`, and `namba fix --command plan` seed `.namba/specs/<SPEC>/reviews/product.md`, `engineering.md`, `design.md`, and `readiness.md`.
- Frontend-touching planning also seeds `.namba/specs/<SPEC>/frontend-brief.md`, and explicit `frontend-major` work uses that brief as the canonical gate contract.
- `$namba-plan-review` bundles SPEC creation or resolution, the three review tracks, and an aggregate validation loop when you want that whole pre-implementation pass handled through one skill.
- `$namba-plan-pm-review`, `$namba-plan-eng-review`, and `$namba-plan-design-review` update those review artifacts directly in the repository.
- `namba run`, `namba sync`, and `namba pr` surface the latest readiness summary as advisory context for non-frontend and `frontend-minor` work, while explicit `frontend-major` runs can block on missing, insufficient, invalid, or mismatched frontend evidence.

## Output Contract

- `AGENTS.md` defines a Namba report header such as `# NAMBA-AI Work Report` for substantial responses.
- The report sections follow this semantic order: `🧭 Scope` -> `🧠 Decision` -> `🛠 Work Completed` -> `🚧 Current Issues` -> `⚠ Potential Risks` -> `➡ Next Steps`.
- The semantic order stays fixed, but the exact labels can vary within the selected language palette so the writing does not become robotic.
- `.namba/codex/validate-output-contract.py` checks this contract from a saved response file or stdin.
- Namba keeps the validator script as the explicit repository enforcement path even as Codex's documented config and hook surface evolves.

## Git Collaboration Defaults

- Each SPEC or new task uses a dedicated branch from `main`.
- Recommended branch names: `spec/<SPEC-ID>-<slug>` for SPEC work and `task/<slug>` for non-SPEC work.
- PRs target `main`.
- PR titles and bodies should be written in English.
- After the GitHub PR is open, confirm the `@codex review` review request is present.

## Claude to Codex Mapping

- `CLAUDE.md` becomes `AGENTS.md`.
- Claude skills become repo-local Codex skills under `.agents/skills/`.
- Claude command wrappers become command-entry skills such as `$namba-create`, `$namba-run`, `$namba-queue`, `$namba-pr`, `$namba-land`, `$namba-plan`, `$namba-sync`, `$namba-review-resolve`, and `$namba-release`.
- Claude subagents map to Codex built-in subagents plus project-scoped `.toml` custom agents, with `.md` mirrors kept for readability.
- Claude hooks become explicit validator scripts, documented response contracts, and sync steps in Namba.
- Claude custom workflow commands become `$namba`, command-entry repo skills, built-in Codex slash commands, and the `namba` CLI.

## Important Distinction

- In interactive Codex sessions, `namba run SPEC-XXX` means Codex should execute the SPEC directly in-session.
- The standalone `namba run` CLI supports the default runner flow plus explicit `--solo`, `--team`, and worktree-based `--parallel` modes.
- Tokens and PATs are intentionally excluded from generated config. Use `gh auth login` or `glab auth login` instead.
